# Product Vision: Drift Clock

## Overview
A clock app that looks stock but isn't. Timers & Stopwatch run at adjustable speeds—faster or slower than real time. Perfect for training intervals, workout mind games, party tricks, or testing your perception.

## Problem Statement
People want to manipulate their perception of time during workouts, study sessions, and for entertainment purposes—but existing timer apps are obviously "different" and break the illusion.

## Solution
Drift Clock disguises itself as the stock Android Clock app while secretly running timers and stopwatches at user-defined speeds. The deception is the feature—time manipulation hidden in plain sight.
